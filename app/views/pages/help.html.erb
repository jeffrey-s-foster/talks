<h1>Help</h1>

<p>
This web site helps make it easy to disseminate information about
talks. There are two basic entities the site tracks:
<i>talks</i> and <i>lists</i>. Talks include basic information about a
presentation, including the speaker, date/time, venue, abstract, etc,
and each talk may be cross-posted to one or more lists. Lists contain
a set of talks, and typically correspond to a particular seminar
series or other theme.

<p>
Information about lists and talks is open to anyone, but to take full
advantage of the site, you'll need to create an account. Once you do
so, you can <i>subscribe</i> to lists or individual talks, and then
receive your cumulative subscription in one or more ways, including as
email reminders at a rate you select; an ical feed; and an rss feed.

<p>
The goal of this site is to make it easy to post a talk so the right
set of people will see it, to eliminate duplicate talk announcements,
and to cut down on spam reminders about talks.

<p>
This site requires JavaScript to work fully. If you use the site with
JavaScript turned off, it may behave unexpectedly.

<h2>Your Account</h2>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>
You can register for the site by clicking the <%= link_to "register",
new_user_registration_path %> link near the top of the page. To
register, you must provide your email address and a password. We also
ask you to provide your name and your organization (leave this blank
if you are affiliated with UMD). After you register, you will receive
an email with a confirmation link you must follow to activate your
registration. You can click on 
<%= link_to "Didn't receive confirmation instructions?",
    new_confirmation_path(:user) %> on the registration page
to resend the confirmation email. Once your account is activated, you
may <%= link_to "log in", new_user_session_path %>.

<h3>Subscriptions</h3>

<p>
Once you log in to the site, you can subscribe to talks or
lists. To subscribe to a talk or list, go to its page when you are
logged in and click the subscribe button. If you want to cancel a
subscription, click the unsubscribe button.

<p>
Once you have subscribed to some lists or talks, you can go to your
profile page (click your name above) to see a cumulative list of all
the upcoming taks you have subscribed to, either directly (by
subscribing to the talk itself) or indirectly (by subscribing to a
list containing the talk). Even if a talk appears on multiple lists
you are subscribed to, you should only see it once on your list. As
new talks are posted to lists you subscribe to, your list of upcoming
talks will automatically be updated with those talks.

<p>
There are several ways to receive information your upcoming talks
subscription:
<ul>
<li>By default, you will receive an email each Sunday containing a
  list of upcoming talks for that week, and an email each day
  containing a list of upcoming talks for that day. You can disable
  this feature by editing your profile (see the link on your account
  page).
<li>Your account page includes a link to a calendar feed containing
  your talk information. If your browser recognizes
  the <tt>webcal://</tt> protocol, then clicking on the link should
  ask your calendar program to subscribe to the feed. Otherwise, you
  may need to cut and paste the calendar feed URL into your calendar
  program.
<li>Your account page also include a link to an atom feed containing
  your talk information. You can subscribe to that feed using your
  favorite rss reader.
</ul>

<p>
Even if you decide not to create an account on the site, you can still
receive talk information automatically: each list and each talk has
its own calendar feed button, and each list also has an atom feed
button. However, if you subscribe this way the site cannot remove
duplicate talk announcements, and it cannot send you email.

<p>
<i>The following functionality is not yet implemented:</i>
In addition to subscribing to talks and lists, you may
also <i>watch</i> a talk or list. In this case, the talk or list is
not added to your list of upcoming talks. However, you will receive an
email whenever there is an update to the talk or list. This is most
useful when you want to keep track of the talks posted on a list, but
you don't necessarily want to attend all of them; you can watch the
list, and then subscribe individually to each talk you want on your
upcoming talk list.

<h3>Badges</h3>

<p>
If you are logged in, you may see a number of badges next to talk
and list names. The badges have the following meanings:

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="badge-subscriber"></span></td>
    <td>You are subscribed to this talk/list</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="badge-watcher"></span></td>
    <td>You are watching this talk/list</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="badge-subscriber-through"></span></td>
    <td>You are subscribed to this talk because you are subscribed to
    a list containing it</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="badge-watcher-through"></span></td>
    <td>You are watching this talk because you are watching a list
    containing it</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="badge-registered"></span></td>
    <td>You are registered for this talk</td>
  </tr>
